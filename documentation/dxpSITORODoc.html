    Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The EPICS DXP module provides support for the SITORO based digital signal processor
    based multichannel analyzers from <a href="http://www.xia.com">X-ray Instrumentation
      Associates (XIA)</a>. These devices include the FalconXN models, and all contain
    the functional equivalent of the shaping amplifier, ADC, and MCA of a conventional
    pulse-height analysis system. The FalconX is based on the SITORO technology from
    <a href="http://southerninnovation.com/products/">Southern Innovation</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    dxpSITORO supports the 1, 4, and 8 channel versions of the FalconX.</p>
  <p>
    dxpSITORO currently supports this hardware under the following operating systems
    and compilers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Linux with gcc.</li>
    <li>Windows with Visual Studio 2015 or later.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The features of the EPICS software, compared with the ProSpect software available
    from XIA are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Control and data acquisition are available over the network, from any application
      or language that supports the EPICS Channel Access protocol (based on TCP/IP). This
      means that EPICS clients written in languages like Python, IDL, LabView, etc. can
      control the DXP modules and read the data. These applications can be running on
      any computer on the Internet, they do not need to run on the computer that is attached
      to the XIA hardware. This client/server model is very desirable in complex data
      acquisition environments, such as synchrotron beamlines, because it allows the DXP
      control and data acquisition to be integrated with other hardware and software.
      For example, a control software program can move a motor, command the DXP to acquire
      data, and write the data to disk.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="Architecture">
    Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    The software consists of the following components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/">asyn port driver</a>.
      This driver is implements a class called <a href="dxpDoxygenHTML/class_n_d_dxp.html">
        NDDxp</a>, which is derived from the <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetectorDoc.html#asynNDArrayDriver">
          asynNDArrayDriver</a> and <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/R4-31/asynPortDriver.html">
            asynPortDriver</a> base C++ classes. The driver communicates with the hardware
      using the <a href="falconxn.pdf">XIA Handel library</a>, which in turn communicates
      with the Southern Innovation SINC library. </li>
    <li>An EPICS <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/mcaRecord.html">MCA
      record</a> for each detector. This communicates with the driver via the asyn MCA
      device support. This support allows each detector to be treated identically with
      other supported MCA hardware, such as the Canberra AIM. The MCA record is used for
      data acquisition in the non-mapping modes, and to define regions of interest.</li>
    <li>A set of standard EPICS records (ai, ao, bi, bo, waveform, etc.) that are used
      to set all of the many software selectable parameters for the FalconX, including
      pulse separation, detection threshold, etc. These are also used for data acquisition
      in the mapping modes and to acquire diagnostic data, such as the ADC trace. These
      records use the standard asyn device support.</li>
    <li>A State Notation Language program (dxpMED) for synchronizing acquisition, ROIs,
      and FalconX parameters in multi-element detector systems.</li>
    <li>Support for the plugins from the <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetector.html">
      areaDetector</a> package. These plugins are used to stream data to disk in the mappping
      modes, and to define ROIs.</li>
    <li>Databases for single-element and multi-element detector systems.</li>
    <li>medm display screens.</li>
    <li>Example IOC boot directories for the FalconX.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The overall architecture of the EPICS DXP software is shown in the diagram below.
    At the top level are EPICS Channel Access client applications, such as the IDL MCA
    Display program, the Python Multi-Element Detector control programs, medm, spec,
    and others.</p>

    EPICS Records and Databases</h2>
  <p>
    This document does not attempt to explain the meaning or use of all of the FalconX
    parameters. The best documentation of the operation of the FalconX modules is provided
    by XIA in the <a href="FalconXn_QSG.pdf">FalconX Quick Start Guide</a>. This also
    describe the ProSpect software, which is useful to set up test the hardware.</p>
  <p>
    For many parameters in the following databases there is both an EPICS output record
    (ao, bo, mbbo, etc.) and a corresponding EPICS input record (ai, bi, mbbi, etc.).
    The output record is used to set a new value in the hardware. The input record has
    an _RBV suffix, which stands for Read Back Value. It is used to read back the actual
    value from the hardware, which may be different from the requested value because
    of limitations of the hardware, errors, etc.</p>
  <p>
    When the EPICS IOC starts the initial values of the records are set in the following
    order:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The default value in the record definition, typically 0.</li>
    <li>The value specified in the database file (.template or .substitutions file)</li>
    <li>The value read back from the hardware or Handel library. This will be the Handel
      default value, or the value from the .ini file if it is defined there.</li>
    <li>The value from save/restore.</li>
    <li>The value from a "dbpf" in the startup script.</li>
    <li>The value set from the SNL program on startup.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Steps 1-3 apply to both output records and to input records. Steps 4 and 5 typically
    only apply to output records, and step 7 only to input records. If there is no auto_settings*.sav
    file then most of the DXP parameter records will obtain their initial values from
    the .ini file. Thus, by deleting the auto_settings*.sav file one can force EPICS
    to use the same parameters that have been saved into an .ini file by ProSpect.</p>
  <h3 id="dxpHighLevel">
    dxpHighLevel.template</h3>
  <p>
    The following records are defined in the database dxpHighLevel.template. They control
    the high-level DXP parameters such as peaking time, etc. One instance of this database
    is loaded for each detector channel in the system. All of the record names in the
    template file are preceeded by the macro parameters $(P)$(R), where $(P) is the
    prefix for this detector system, and $(R) is the name of this specific channel.
    $(P) should be unique for all EPICS IOCs on the subnet, and $(R) is typically dxp1:,
    dxp2:, etc.</p>

    The following records are defined in the database dxpMED.template (MED stands for
    Multi-Element Detector). One instance of this database is loaded for each system,
    since they control system-wide parameters. Only the records in this database that
    are intended for use by EPICS clients are documented here. Records that are not
    intended to be accessed from clients are not documented, since they may be changed
    in the future. Records in this database are implemented in several ways. Some are
    connected to an MCA record that is configured with a special address that signifies
    that it controls all detector channels. That record communicates directly with the
    driver. Other records are implemented in a State Notation Language program which
    monitors the system-wide records like PresetMode, and copies them to the individual
    detector records.</p>
  <p>
    All of the record names in the template file are preceeded by the macro parameter

          be gate_master, another module can be sync_master, and PixelAdvanceMode can be changed
          between Gate and Sync. <i>Note: there is a bug in the current xMAP firmware, so that
            a module defined to be a sync_master will always use its pulse input for pixel_advance,
            even if another module is defined to be gate_master, and PixelAdvanceMode is defined
            to be Gate. This should be fixed in a future firmware release, but for now if a
            sync_master is defined in the system then only use Sync for PixelAdvanceMode.</i>

          when the Apply record is set to 1. Choices are 0=No, 1=Yes. This flag can dramatically
          affect performance, because the process of downloading parameters to the xMAP or
          Mercury is very slow, requiring about 0.3 seconds. If many parameters need to be
          changed it is much faster to do the following:
          <ol>
            <li>Set AutoApply=No</li>
            <li>Change a number of parameters</li>
            <li>Write 1 to the Apply record</li>
            <li>Set AutoApply back to Yes</li>
          </ol>
          The EPICS driver sets AutoApply=No when the driver is initialized. This means that
          all of the parameter setting that occurs during driver initialization and during
          iocInit when the records are initialized by EPICS is very fast because the values
          are not actually downloaded to the hardware. At the end of the EPICS startup script
          there are "dbpf" commands to write 1 to the Apply record (forcing a download), and
          to set AutoApply=Yes. Most operations that the users will do involve setting a only
          a few parameters, such as PeakingTime, etc. These are fast even with AutoApply=Yes,
          so it is normally left in this state. That way the user does not have to worry about
          performing a manual apply operation with the Apply record. The one operation that
          does involve setting a very large number of parameters is processing the CopyROI_SCA
          record, which redefines all of the SCAs for each detector. This is handled by the
          SNL program, which does the following:
          <ol>
            <li>Saves the current state of AutoApply</li>
            <li>Sets AutoApply=No</li>
            <li>Copies all of the new SCA parameters for each detector from the MCA records</li>
            <li>Writes 1 to the Apply record</li>
            <li>Sets AutoApply back to previous value</li>
          </ol>
          This performance optimization was added in R3-0, and reduces the time to copy ROIs
          from several minutes in previous releases to less than 2 seconds in R3-0 for a 16-channel
          xMAP system. </td>

    Using mapping modes with the xMAP and Mercury</h2>
  <p>
    In the mapping modes on the xMAP and Mercury data are collected into a double-buffered
    memory on the module. When one half of the buffer memory is full the EPICS driver
    reads the data from that buffer into an <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetectorDoc.html#NDArray">
      NDArray object.</a> It then calls any registered <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/pluginDoc.html">
        plugins</a> with that NDArray. The plugins will typically be one of the <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/NDPluginFile.html">
          NDPluginFile</a> plugins which will write the data to disk. The useful file
    plugins can write the data in netCDF, NeXus/HDF5, and TIFF formats. The JPEG plugin
    will not be useful, because the data are not images. The data can also be passed
    to the <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/NDPluginStdArrays.html">NDPluginStdArrays</a>
    plugin which can make the data available to EPICS channel access clients as waveform
    records.</p>
  <p>
    The data in each NDArray object is a 16-bit unsigned integer array with dimensions
    [BufferSize, ModulesPerSystem]. BufferSize is the size of the double-buffered memory
    in use, which is controlled by the AutoPixelsPerBuffer and PixelsPerBuffer records.
    It has a maximum value of 2^20 (1048576) but can be smaller than this. ModulesPerSystem
    is the total number of xMAP modules in the system, and is always 1 for the Mercury.
    In MCA mapping and SCA mapping modes the buffer for each module in this array contains
    the data for each pixel, including the elapsed live and real time, triggers and
    events, and the MCA or SCA data. In List mapping mode the buffer contains the event
    data for each x-ray event. The details of the buffer structure are beyond the scope
    of this document, but the buffer structure is thoroughly described in the section
    entitled "Mapping Mode Data" in the <a href="XMAP_User_Manual.pdf">xMAP User's Manual</a>
    and <a href="Mercury_User_Manual.pdf">Mercury User's Manual</a>.

    The EPICS software does not provide records to configure the Gate, Sync, or LBUS
    masters in the system. This is because there can be a variable number of these depending
    on how many PCI bus segments the xMAPs use. The Gate, Sync, and LBUS masters should
    be configured with the xManager configuration wizard, or by directly editing the
    .ini file. The values for the masters in the .ini file will be used, EPICS does
    not modify them.</p>

    To collect mapping mode data one would typically execute the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select the mapping mode (CollectMode record)</li>
    <li>In MCA mapping and SCA mapping modes:
      <ul>
        <li>Select the pixel advance mode (PixelAdvanceMode record)</li>
        <li>Select the number of pixels per run (PixelsPerRun record)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In List Mapping mode:
      <ul>
        <li>Select the list mode variant (ListMode record)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In the netCDF plugin
      <ul>
        <li>Set the Enable record to Enable.</li>
        <li>Set the FilePath, FileName, FileNumber, FileTemplate, AutoIncrement, FileWriteMode,
          NumCapture, and Autosave records to the desired values. Typically AutoIncrement=Yes,
          FileWriteMode=Stream, NumCapture= number of buffers to be captured = PixelsPerRun/PixelsPerBuffer.</li>
        <li>If FileWriteMode is Stream or Capture then start capture/streaming with the Capture
          record. <i>NOTE: Before stream or capture can be started there must have been at least
            1 callback to the plugin in the current mapping mode with the same CollectMode and
            PixelsPerBuffer currently in use. This is because stream and capture modes need
            to know the buffer size that will be received at the time that capture/streaming
            is started. This can be done by simply enabling the file plugin and doing a quick
            run. Just start a run, advance a few pixels with the NextPixel record, and stop
            the run. Even though only a few pixels have been collected the entire buffer is
            read out, so the size is correct.</i></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Start acquisition with the EraseStart record.</li>
    <li>In MCA mapping or SCA mapping modes do something that causes the pixels to advance.
      This could be using the NextPixel record, or an external advance source such as
      a pulse generator, motor pulse train, etc. In List mapping modes the buffer fills
      up with event data even if the Sync or Gate pixel clock is not advancing.</li>
    <li>Each time a buffer fills up the netCDF plugin will be called, writing data to
      disk.</li>
    <li>In MCA mapping mode each time the buffer fills up the MCA spectra for the first
      pixel in that buffer will be sent to the MCA records, so they can be displayed.
      This provides a periodic visual feedback on the MCA data.</li>
    <li>In MCA and SCA mapping modes once the requested number of pixels per run has occured
      acquisition will automatically stop. In List mapping mode acquisition must be manually
      stopped with the StopAll record.</li>
    <li>If the netCDF plugin is in stream or capture mode and NumCapture was specified
      correctly, then it will also automatically stop capturing when the last buffer is
      received. If NumCapture was 0 or was too large, then stream/capture should be manually
      stopped by writing 0 to the Capture record.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Data acquisition in mapping mode is very flexible. When doing a 2-D map, for example,
    one could stream the data for the entire map into a single large netCDF file. Alternatively,
    one could save just a single scan row into each file, and restart the file plugin
    for each row, using a new file name, or auto-increment on the file number. Data
    can also be saved into NeXus or TIFF files, rather than netCDF files.</p>
  <p>
    Which mapping mode to use depends on the needs of the experiment. If only the counts
    in ROIs are needed then it is most efficient to collect data in SCA mapping mode.
    The counts in the SCAs are the total counts, with no background subtraction. However,
    it is possible to define additional SCAs in regions of no peaks, and correct for
    background during post-processing by using these "background" SCAs to estimate the
    background counts per channel. List mapping mode can be used to collect data with
    very high time resolution (20 ns). It is also often more faster and more efficient
    in disk space than MCA mapping mode, with essentially the same information. The
    speed and file size in List mapping mode depends of course on the number of x-rays
    per second. Each x-ray event requires 6 bytes (2 for the x-ray energy, and 4 for
    the clock time or pixel number). Consider a 4-detector xMAP system with a count
    rate of 100,000 cps per detector. The total data rate in List mapping mode will
    be 4 detectors * 100,000 events/s * 6 bytes/event = 2.4 MB/sec. That can be compared
    to running the same system in MCA mapping mode with 2048 channel spectra at the
    fastest possible pixel rate, 1000 pixels/s. In that case the data rate is 4 detectors
    * 2048 channels * 2 bytes/channel * 1000 pixels/s = 16MB/s. In this case List mapping
    results in almost 7 times less data than MCA mapping, because most of the spectral
    channels are 0 in MCA spectra mode. The only significant difference is that in list
    mode there is no measure of live time at each "pixel", and it will require more
    post-processing to arrange the data into spectra, if that is what is desired.</p>
  <p>
    This is a Python program called <a href="fast_mapping_py.html">fast_mapping.py</a>
    that implements such a 2-D scan. This is a simple program that was written by Yan
    Fen and me at the SSRF (Shanghai Synchrotron). It works as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The system contains an SIS3820 multi-channel scaler. This has its external channel
      advance connected to the stepper motor pulses driving the X sample stage. The External
      Prescale is set to divide these pulses by the number of motor pulses per pixel.
      Each time the X stage motor moves by this amount the SIS3820 collects the data from
      the ion chamber (I0) and other counter inputs into its MCA records. It also outputs
      a trigger pulse on its CIP output, which is input into the xMAP Sync input to do
      a pixel advance on the xMAP.</li>
    <li>There are 2 EPICS sscan records.
      <ul>
        <li>X15U1:test:scan1 is the fast inner scan. It drives the X stage motor. It is configured
          to collect 1-D arrays, which are the SIS3820 MCA records. These are saved into MDA
          files by the saveData utility in EPICS. It has detector triggers for the SIS3820
          EraseStart PV. However, this is just to forces the sscan record wait until the SIS3820
          is done at the end of the row. It is actually necessary to start the SIS3820 and
          xMAPs <i>before</i> the scan starts. This is because the sscan record begins moving
          the motor before it fires its detector triggers, and that will not work here, they
          need to start counting <i>before</i> the motor starts moving. When each row is collected
          this scan is started by the Python script. It will save the SIS3820 counters into
          a separate MDA file for each row, because it does not think a 2-D EPICS scan is
          in progress.</li>
        <li>X15U1:test:scan2 is the slow outer scan. Its positioner is the Z stage motor.
          However, we are only using this scan as a convenient place for the user to enter
          the start, end, step size and number of points of the Z scan. This scan record is
          not actually executed. Rather the Python program reads the PVs for this scan and
          moves the motor itself. The reason for this is that there are things that need to
          be done at the start of each row that are much more easily done in the Python program
          than in the sscan record. This includes setting up the netCDF file plugin, starting
          the SIS3820 and xMAP, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>At the very beginning of the 2-D scan the Python code does the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Reads the size of the scan in the X and Z directions (nFast, nSlow) from the sscan
          records.</li>
        <li>Writes nFast into the NuseAll PV of the SIS3820 so that it stops after this many
          channel advances. It also writes nFast into the xMAP PixelsPerRun PV to set the
          number of pixels per run.</li>
        <li>Computes the number of xMAP buffers that each scan row will require. This is ((nFast+1)/124
          + 1), because each buffer can hold 124 pixels when collecting 2048 channel spectra.
          (To be more general it should read the value of PixelsPerBuffer from the xMAP rather
          than hardcoding 124). Writes this value into the NumCapture PV of the netCDF plugin.</li>
        <li>Writes the desired base file name into the FileName PV of the netCDF plugin.</li>
        <li>Writes 1 into the FileNumber PV of the netCDF plugin. The netCDF file plugin was
          also previously configured to have a valid FilePath, AutoIncrement=Yes, and FileTemplate="%s%s_%d.nc".
          It was thus saving files with names like MyScan_1.nc, MyScan_2.nc, ... for rows
          1, 2, ... of the scan.</li>
        <li>Sets the netCDF file plugin FileWriteMode PV to Stream (choice 2). This means
          that all of the pixels for one scan row will be streamed into a single netCDF file.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Python program then executes a 1-D loop over the number of rows (Z stage pixels)
      in the scan. For each row of the scan it does the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Starts the netCDF plugin streaming by writing 1 to the Capture PV.</li>
        <li>Sets the speed of the X stage motor to its fast flyback speed.</li>
        <li>Starts the X stage moving to the start position.</li>
        <li>Starts the Z stage moving to the position for this row.</li>
        <li>Waits for the X and Z stages to arrive at their target positions.</li>
        <li>Sets the speed of the X stage motor to the desired scan speed (i.e. pixel size
          / time per pixel).</li>
        <li>Erases and starts the SIS3820.</li>
        <li>Erases and starts the xMAP. Waits 0.5 seconds after this to allow the xMAP to
          be ready.</li>
        <li>Starts the fast scan (scan 1). That will start the X stage moving, and will wait
          for the SIS3820 to complete. saveData will write the SIS3820 MCA data to the MDA
          file at the end of the scan row.</li>
        <li>Waits for the xMAP to be done.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    There are IDL functions available in the <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/idl/detectors.html">
      CARS IDL detector package</a> to conveniently extract the MCA, SCA, or List mode

  <p>
    The following is an IDL program that calls read_xmap_2d for a 501x500 scan of a
    Ni mesh. It extracts the Ni Ka peak (channels 716 to 776) from the data. It sums
    over all the channels in this region, normalizes by live time, sums over all 7 detectors,
    and finally displays the image with the IDL iTools iimage procedure.</p>
  <pre>    ; Read data, only channels 716 to 776
    d = read_xmap_2d('Scan4_', 501, live_time=live_time, real_time=real_time, $

    Installing the EPICS DXP software</h2>
  <p>
    To install the EPICS DXP software first decide whether you want to build the EPICS
    DXP software from source code, or install the pre-built binaries. Most users will
    just download the pre-built binaries. The Windows binaries should run on almost
    any version of Windows. The Linux binaries are built with Redhat Fedora kernel 2.6.27
    and gcc version 4.3.0. These binaries should run on many recent versions of Linux,
    but this has not been extensively tested.</p>
  <p>
    Building from the source code requires downloading <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/base/index.php">
      EPICS base</a> and all of the required <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/aod/bcda/synApps/index.php">
        synApps components</a>. To build from source code on Windows for the win32-x86
    architecture requires Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 or later, plus perl and
    make. To build from source code on Windows for the cygwin32-x86 architecture requires
    the gcc, g++, perl and make packages from Cygwin. It is beyond the scope of this
    document to describe how to build the source code. Consult other EPICS documentation
    for this.</p>
  <p>
    The DXP software provides example IOC directories, iocBoot/iocSaturn, iocBoot/iocXMAP,
    iocBoot/iocMercury, and iocBoot/iocDXP2X. These create EPICS process variables with
    names like dxpSaturn:dxp1.PKTIM, where dxpSaturn is the "prefix" for the process
    variable names, dxp1 is the DXP record name, and PKTIM is the field name. The default
    prefixes are dxpSaturn:, dxpXMAP:, dxpMercury, and dxp2X:. These prefixes would
    be OK for installations where there will be at most one IOC of a given type on the
    subnet. However, in many cases there will be the possibility of more than one DXP
    module running EPICS on the same subnet. If this is the case then it is essential
    that each one use a different prefix, because EPICS process variable names must
    be unique on a subnet. The following is how to give your IOC a unique prefix, and
    still be able to upgrade the EPICS software easily. It is recommended that you follow
    these instructions even if you don't have name conflicts on your subnet, so that
    files you edit are in a directory that will not be overwritten when you upgrade
    the EPICS software.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make a copy of the iocSaturn, iocXMAP, iocMercury, or iocDXP2X directory. Let's
      assume you have a Saturn and will make your prefix be APSSat1:, so a good name for
      the directory would be iocAPSSat1.</li>
    <li>Edit all files in that directory (including st.cmd, and START_IOC*), changing
      all occurances of dxpSaturn: to APSSat1:.</li>
    <li>If you have created any higher-level medm screens that load the medm screens in
      this package, you will need to edit them to pass the new prefix, APSSat1:</li>
    <li>The next time you unpack a new version of the EPICS DXP software it will overwrite
      the iocSaturn directory. However, if you have made your own new directory, APSSat1/,
      that will not be modified.</li>
    <li>For the multi-element systems (iocXMAP, iocMercury, iocDXP2X) the files to be
      edited include, for example, 4element.cmd, 4element.substitutions, and START_EPICS.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The EPICS DXP application uses the EPICS save/restore facility. This means that
    all of the important parameters that you might change when running the DXP software
    are saved in files in the subdirectory called autosave/ under your IOC directory.
    These parameters include the peaking time, the update rates for displays and many
    other parameters. The next time EPICS is started it will restore these values automatically
    from the file called autosave/auto_settings.sav. On multi-element systems the files
    are called auto_settings4.sav, or auto_settings16.sav, etc. It is a good idea to
    make copies of this file from time to time so that you can get back to old settings
    if the file is lost or corrupted.</p>
  <p>
    The DXP IOC application and EPICS clients both need to be able to start the EPICS
    caRepeater application. This application is built as part of EPICS base. If you
    are installing the Linux or Windows prebuilt versions of the DXP software you can
    obtain caRepeater as part of the <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/pub/EPICS_WIN32_binaries.zip">
      EPICS WIN32 binaries</a> or <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/pub/EPICS_Linux_binaries.tar">
        EPICS Linux binaries</a> from our Web site. Unpack these directories into a
    directory on your computer, and put that directory into your PATH environment variable.
    That way EPICS will be able to find caRepeater. It will also provide many useful
    EPICS shell utilities, such as caput, caget, camonitor, etc. The IDL ezcaIDL.dll
    and ezcaIDL.so shareable libraries are also in that distribution.</p>
  <h3 id="Installing_Windows">
    Installing the DXP software on Windows</h3>
  <p>
    To install the EPICS DXP software with a Saturn, Mercury, or xMAP on a Windows PC
    do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Install the <a href="http://www.driverlinx.com">Windows Port IO Driver</a> from
      Scientific Software Tools. This is a software driver that lets Windows applications
      communicate with I/O ports, including the Enhanced Parallel Port. Although this
      is only needed to communicate with the EPP port, the driver must be installed even
      if the EPP port will not be used, because the EPICS dxpApp application is linked
      with that DLL. The driver (port95NT.exe and dlportio.sys) is also included in the
      handelSrc/ (source version) and bin/win32-x86 (pre-built binary version) directories
      in the DXP distribution. It can also be found in the Handel source code distribution
      which is available through the <a href="http://www.xia.com/Software/downloads">XIA
        software downloads</a> Web site. The driver is found in the redist/drivers/usb1
      directory.</li>
    <li>To use the parallel port (EPP) interface on older Saturns and SII Vortex units:
      <ul>
        <li>Configure the parallel port to be in EPP mode. This requires entering the BIOS
          setup screen on the computer before the operating system boots. The menus will differ
          from one computer to another, but it is necessary to set the parallel port to EPP
          mode. Other modes will not work.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To use the USB 1.0 interface with the Saturn:
      <ul>
        <li>Install the <a href="http://www.xia.com/DXP_Saturn_Software.html">ProSpect</a>
          from XIA. This will install the required Windows driver for the USB 1.0 Saturn.
          The driver (ezusb.sys, xiausb.inf) is also included in the handelSrc/ (source version)
          and bin/win32-x86 (pre-built binary version) directories in the DXP distribution.
          The driver can also be found in the Handel source code distribution which is available
          through the <a href="http://www.xia.com/Software/downloads">XIA software downloads</a>
          Web site. The driver is found in the redist/drivers/usb1 directory.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To use the USB 2.0 interface with the Saturn or Mercury:
      <ul>
        <li>Install the <a href="http://www.xia.com/DXP_Saturn_Software.html">ProSpect</a>
          from XIA. This will install the required Windows EZ-USB driver for the USB 2.0 Saturn.
          The driver (cyusb.sys, cyusbme.sys, xia_usb2.inf) is also included in the handelSrc/
          (source version) and bin/win32-x86 (pre-built binary version) directories in the
          DXP distribution. The driver can also be found in the Handel source code distribution
          which is available through the <a href="http://www.xia.com/Software/downloads">XIA
            software downloads</a> Web site. The driver is found in the redist/drivers/usb2
          directory.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For an xMAP system do the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Install the PCI/PXI converter from National Instruments.</li>
        <li>Install the National Instruments driver software.</li>
        <li>Install the latest version of the xManager software from XIA. This will install
          the Plx driver that is used to communicate with the xMAP modules. It will also run
          a Configuration Wizard that will create an initial .ini file with the correct PCI
          bus and slot addresses for your system. You can copy that file to the iocXMAP directory
          or edit one of the .ini files there that most closely matches your system configuration
          (xmap4.ini, xmap8.ini, etc.). It is useful to have xManager available on the computer
          to compare with the EPICS software. The driver (Plx9054.sys, xia9054.inf) is also
          included in the handelSrc/ (source version) and bin/win32-x86 (pre-built binary
          version) directories in the DXP distribution. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Chose whether to use the Cygwin (cygwin-x86) or native Windows (win32-x86) version
      of the EPICS software. The main reason to use Cygwin is to run the saveData utility,
      which will save EPICS scan data to disk. This utility does not currently run under
      the native Windows version because it lacks the Sun RPC library.</li>
    <li>If using Cygwin then install the basic <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin
      package</a>. Cygwin is a public domain package that provides Unix-like programming
      libraries and commands on Windows. When using the Cygwin install program use all
      of the default settings, which will install just the basic package into C:\Cywgin.</li>
    <li>If you want to run the medm display program on the Windows PC, which is recommended
      in most cases, you need to install <a href="http://www.hummingbird.com/products/nc/exceed/index.html?cks=y">
        Exceed</a>. Exceed is a commercial X-Windows package from Hummingbird. After installing
      Exceed you need to install the <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/download/distributions/index.php">
        EPICS Win32 Extensions</a>, which contain medm. Note that medm works with some
      non-commercial versions of X windows servers for Windows, but Exceed is guaranteed
      to work.</li>
    <li>Download <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/dxp.html">the latest
      standalone release</a> of the EPICS DXP software, containing Cygwin and native Windows
      binaries.</li>
    <li>Unpack that distribution into a directory such as C:\EPICS or C:\Program Files\EPICS.
      The distribution file, dxpStandlone_XXX.tgz can be unpacked using WinZip, or with
      the gunzip and tar utilities that come with Cygwin. To use the Cygwin tools:
      <pre>      $ cd /cygdrive/c/epics         # Or wherever you have chosen to put the EPICS software
      $ tar xzvf dxpStandalone_3-0.tgz    # Unpack the tar file.
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>Make sure that the .bat files in iocBoot/ioc*/ have execute permission. This can
      be done by running the Cygwin bash shell and typing
      <pre>      $ cd iocBoot/iocSaturn
      $ chmod +x *.bat
      </pre>
      This is necessary because these files may not have this permission, depending on
      how they were unpacked from the distribution.</li>
    <li>Copy all of the medm .adl files into a single directory. This is simpler than
      defining EPICS_DISPLAY_PATH to point to all of the required directories. For example,
      if you decide to put the .adl files in C:\epics_adls, and if you unpacked the dxp
      tar file distribution into C:\epics, then type the following commands at the Cygwin
      bash shell prompt:
      <pre>      $ mkdir /cygdrive/c/epics_adls
      $ find /cygdrive/c/epics -name '*.adl' -exec cp -f -p -v {} /cygdrive/c/epics_adls \;
      </pre>
      Define the environment variable EPICS_DISPLAY_PATH to point to C:\epics_adls. For
      the Windows shell use the Windows&nbsp;Control&nbsp;Panel/System/Advanced/Environment&nbsp;Variables.
      For the Cygwin shell edit your .bashrc file.</li>
    <li>If you look at that batch file, you will see a line that temporarily sets the
      environment variable PATH to C:\cygwin\bin. You may want to add this directory permanently
      to your Windows path for Windows shells. Again, use the Windows&nbsp;Control&nbsp;Panel/System/Advanced/Environment&nbsp;Variables.
      Modify the definition according to where you have installed Cygwin. Note that the
      PATH will be set to automatically include that directory when running the Cygwin
      bash shell.</li>
    <li>If you installed pre-built binaries, rather than building from source, then edit
      the envPaths file in iocBoot/iocSaturn. Change the paths to the locations of the
      directories on your system. Don't worry about the path for directories that don't
      exist, like SNCSEQ, EPICS_BASE, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The DXP software uses the EPICS areaDetector module for the file-saving plugins
    that are used in mapping modes. Some of these plugins use Windows DLLs. These DLLs
    are provided with the prebuilt version of the DXP software, in the areaDetector/bin/win32-x86
    or cygwin-x86 directories. Windows needs to be able to find these DLLs when you
    run the DXP software. The easiest way to do this is to put the path to the DLLs
    in your Windows PATH environment variable. This is done in the example startup scripts
    in the iocBoot directories.</p>
  <p>
    The XIA software is very slow when downloading the firmware files (.fdd files) to
    the hardware when the files reside on a remote file system. It is best to put the
    FDD files on a local file system, particularly when using an xMAP system with multiple
    xMAP modules.</p>
  <p>
    There is a known problem with EPICS clients losing connections to a Cygwin IOC when
    they subscribe to a large number of array callbacks. This can happen with DXP application,
    since clients may subscribe to callbacks from many MCA records. This can affect
    any client, such as IDL, medm, the EPICS sscan record, Python, etc. It is a serious
    problem that appears to be a bug in Cygwin itself. Hopefully it will be tracked
    down and fixed in the future. If you do not need to use the saveData function in
    the DXP IOC itself, then you can work around this problem by using the win32-x86
    version of the DXP software.</p>
  <h3 id="Installing_Linux">
    Installing the DXP software on Linux</h3>
  <p>
    To use the EPICS DXP software with a Saturn or Mercury on a Linux computer do the
    following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To use the USB 1.0 or USB 2.0 interface:
      <ul>
        <li>Install the latest version (0.1.12 or later) of <a href="http://libusb.sourceforge.net">
          libusb from SourceForge</a>. This software must be installed using the root account.
          The version of libusb that comes with some Linux systems is older, and often will
          not work, so install this more recent version.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Download <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/dxp.html">the latest
      standalone release</a>, of the EPICS DXP software, containing Linux binaries.</li>
    <li>Unpack that distribution into a directory such as /usr/local/epics. The distribution
      file, dxpStandalone_XXX.tgz can be unpacked using the Linux tar utility, e.g.:
      <pre>      tar xvzf dxpStandalone_3-0.tgz
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>Copy all of the medm .adl files into a single directory. This is simpler than
      defining EPICS_DISPLAY_PATH to point to all of the required directories. For example,
      if you decide to put the .adl files in /home/epics/epics_adls, and if you unpacked
      the dxp tar file distribution into /home/epics/epics, then type the following commands
      at the shell prompt:
      <pre>      $ mkdir /home/epics/epics_adls
      $ find /home/epics/epics -name '*.adl' -exec cp -f -p -v {} /home/epics/epics_adls \;
      </pre>
      Define the environment variable EPICS_DISPLAY_PATH to point to /home/epics/epics_adls.
      Do this by editing your .cshrc or .bashrc file.</li>
    <li>Access to the EPP I/O port on Linux requires root privilege. This can be done
      in any of following 3 ways:
      <ol>
        <li>Prefered method. The EPICS DXP software on Linux contains a program called startWithIopl3.
          This program calls iopl(3) as root, and then reverts back to the non-root account
          to run dxpApp. NOTE: This method does not work on some versions of Linux, probably
          because of SELinux protections that prevent processes started with execv() from
          inheriting the iopl(3) permissions. To use this method the application startWithIopl3
          must be installed as suid root. Do this as follows:
          <pre>> cd bin/linux-x86
> su root
 (password)
> chmod +s startWithIopl3
> exit
</pre>
          The dxpApp application can then be run without root privilege as follows:
          <pre>          > cd iocBoot/iocSaturn
          > ../../bin/linux-x86/startWithIopl3 ../../bin/linux-x86/dxpApp st.cmd
          </pre>
          You can also copy startWithIopl3 to a directory like /usr/local/bin or ~/bin that
          is in your PATH. That way it can be run without having to specify the path. </li>
        <li>Not as good. Install the dxpApp application as suid root. Do this as follows:
          <pre>          > cd bin/linux-x86
          > su root
          (password)
          > chmod +s /bin/linux-x86/dxpApp
          > exit
          </pre>
          The dxpApp application can then be run without root priviledge as follows:
          <pre>          > cd iocBoot/iocSaturn
          > ../../bin/linux-x86/dxpApp st.cmd
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>Least desirable method. Run dxpApp as root:
          <pre>          > cd iocBoot/iocSaturn
          > su root
          (password)
          > ../../bin/linux-x86/dxpApp st.cmd
          or
          > sudo ../../bin/linux-x86/dxpApp st.cmd
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>USB devices on Linux are automatically created with read-only permission for non-root
      users by default. In order to run the dxpApp application without root privilege
      it is necessary to change the device permissions. Because these devices are created
      dynamically when the Saturn or Mercury is connected, this cannot just be done once
      statically. Rather it requires using the "hotplug" or "udev" facilities on Linux
      to have the device permissions set correctly each time the device connects. More
      recent Linux kernels use the "udev" facility, older kernels use the "hotplug" facility.
      I do not know exactly which kernel version the switch to udev was done, but I do
      know from my systems that 2.6.9 uses hotplug while 2.6.22 uses udev. If the directory
      /etc/hotplug exists then the system is presumably using hotplug. In that case the
      directory /dev/bus/usb will probably not exist, only /proc/bus/usb will exist.
      <br />
      Here is a recipe for older systems using hotplug.
      <ol>
        <li>Add the following lines to the file /etc/hotplug/usb.usermap
          <pre># XIA Saturn
usbsaturn  0x0003  0x10e9  0x0700  0x0000  0x0000  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00000000
usbsaturn  0x0003  0x10e9  0x0701  0x0000  0x0000  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00000000
usbsaturn  0x0003  0x10e9  0x0702  0x0000  0x0000  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00000000
usbsaturn  0x0003  0x10e9  0x0703  0x0000  0x0000  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00000000
        </pre>
          These lines instruct the hotplug facility to run the script /etc/hotplug/usb/usbsaturn
          whenever the Saturn or Mercury is added to the system. 10e9 is the vendor ID for
          XIA. 0700 and 0701 are the product IDs for the USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 versions of the
          Saturn. 0702 and 0703 are the product IDs for the Mercury and Mercury4.</li>
        <li>Create the file /etc/hotplug/usb/usbsaturn containing the following lines:
          <pre>          #!/bin/bash

          if [ "${ACTION}" = "add" ] &amp;&amp; [ -f "${DEVICE}" ]
          then
                  chmod 666 "${DEVICE}"
          fi
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
      This script tells hotplug to set the permissions on the XIA USB device to 666 (owner,
      group, and world read/write):
      <pre>         [root@vincent usb]# ls -lt /proc/bus/usb/001/021
         -rw-rw-rw-  1 root root 134 Jan  8 12:20 /proc/bus/usb/001/021
      </pre>
      Here is a recipe for newer systems using udev.
      <ol>
        <li>Create a file in /etc/udev/rules.d called, for example, "80-saturn.rules". Put
          the following lines in this file.
          <pre>           
SUBSYSTEM=="usb",ACTION=="add",ATTRS{idVendor}=="10e9",ATTRS{idProduct}=="0700",MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb",ACTION=="add",ATTRS{idVendor}=="10e9",ATTRS{idProduct}=="0701",MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb",ACTION=="add",ATTRS{idVendor}=="10e9",ATTRS{idProduct}=="0702",MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb",ACTION=="add",ATTRS{idVendor}=="10e9",ATTRS{idProduct}=="0703",MODE="0666"
         </pre>
          These rules instruct the udev facility to set the permissions on the USB device
          to 666 (owner, group and world read/write) for the Saturn or Mercury whenever it
          is added to the system. 10e9 is the vendor ID for XIA. 0700 and 0701 are the product
          IDs for the USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 versions of the Saturn. 0702 and 0703 are the product
          IDs for the Mercury and Mercury4. Note that the 10e9 ID is case sensitive!<br />
          Note that the Linux "udev" facility has been evolving quite rapidly. The above lines
          work on a relatively recent Linux kernel (2.6.27). On older kernels the following
          syntax was required:
          <pre>SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device",ACTION=="add",SYSFS{idVendor}=="10e9",SYSFS{idProduct}=="0700",MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device",ACTION=="add",SYSFS{idVendor}=="10e9",SYSFS{idProduct}=="0701",MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device",ACTION=="add",SYSFS{idVendor}=="10e9",SYSFS{idProduct}=="0702",MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device",ACTION=="add",SYSFS{idVendor}=="10e9",SYSFS{idProduct}=="0703",MODE="0666"
         </pre>
          In the older version the SUBSYSTEM is "usb_device" rather than "usb", and the SYSFS
          keyword rather than ATTRS is used. </li>
        <li>Force the udevd daemon to reload its rules:
          <pre>           $ /sbin/udevcontrol reload_rules
         </pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
      These changes for udev should cause the Saturn or Mercury USB device to have the
      correct permissions:
      <pre>         baja:/etc/udev/rules.d>ls -lt /dev/bus/usb/005/021
         crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 189, 532 2008-01-07 16:08 /dev/bus/usb/005/021
       </pre>
      However, on some Linux versions libusb uses /proc/bus/usb by default, rather than
      /dev/bus/usb, so the permissions set by udev will not have the desired affect. This
      can be fixed by defining the environment variable USB_DEVFS_PATH to be /dev/bus/usb.
      In fact I now add the following command to the EPICS IOC startup script (st.cmd)
      on Linux when using USB, just before the xiaInit command:
      <pre>        # On Linux execute the following command so that libusb uses /dev/bus/usb
        # as the file system for the USB device.  
        # On some Linux systems it uses /proc/bus/usb instead, but udev
        # sets the permissions on /dev, not /proc.
        epicsEnvSet USB_DEVFS_PATH /dev/bus/usb
      </pre>
      This could obviously be done in the shell startup script instead if desired. </li>
    <li>Make sure that the script files in iocBoot/iocSaturn/ and iocBoot/iocMercury have
      execute permission. This can be done by typing
      <pre>      $ cd iocBoot/iocSaturn
      $ chmod +x START_IOC*
      </pre>
      This is necessary because these files may not have this permission, depending on
      how they were unpacked from the distribution.</li>
    <li>If you installed pre-built binaries, rather than building from source, then edit
      the envPaths file in iocBoot/iocSaturn or iocBoot/iocMercury. Change the paths to
      the locations of the directories on your system. Don't worry about the path for
      directories that don't exist, like SNCSEQ, EPICS_BASE, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="Installing_DXP2X">
    Installing the DXP software for the DXP2X</h3>
  <p>
    The DXP4C2X CAMAC module is supported under vxWorks. It works with the Kinetic Systems
    3922/2922 VME to CAMAC adapter.</p>
  <h2 id="Running">
    Running the EPICS DXP software</h2>
  <h3 id="Running_Saturn">
    Running the Saturn</h3>
  <p>
    There are several things that should be done to run Saturn system under the EPICS
    software.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Edit saturn.ini in the IOC directory. Uncomment to appropriate lines to select
      correct the firmware for the Saturn speed (20MHz or 40MHz) and pre-amp type (reset
      or RC). Uncomment the correct lines for the interface you are using (EPP, USB 1.0
      or USB 2.0).</li>
    <li>Edit the saturn.ini to set the polarity, the pre-amp gain, and the time after
      reset (for reset pre-amps) or the RC time constant (for RC pre-amps). Consult the
      <a href="Saturn_User_Manual.pdf">Saturn User's Manual</a> for information on how
      to determine and set these parameters. The saturn.ini file will contain lines like
      the following:
      <pre>      type_value = 10.
      channel0_gain = 1.7
      channel0_polarity = +
      </pre>
      <ul>
        <li>The type_value is the transient settling time after a reset in microseconds for
          reset pre-amps. It is the RC time constant in microseconds for RC pre-amps. 10 microseconds
          is a reasonable value for both of these to start with.</li>
        <li>The gain is specified in mV/keV, and is used so that the energy units in the DXP
          software are correct. Most pre-amps are in the 1-4 mV/keV range. The best way to
          set this value is to set the EMAX parameter (energy of last channel) in EPICS, and
          see how well it agrees with reality when you calibrate the spectrum with a known
          source. Then iteratively edit the saturn.ini file and restart EPICS until the actual
          EMAX matches the requested one. Getting it to within a few percent is fine, since
          you will do accurate calibration of the EPICS MCA spectra when you collect data.</li>
        <li>The polarity can be "+" or "-". A positive polarity means that an x-ray pulse
          produces a voltage step with a rising edge.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Make sure that the switch inside the Saturn is set for the correct pre-amp type.
      The switch is labeled "RAMP" for reset pre-amps and "OFFSET" for RC pre-amps.</li>
    <li>Connect the parallel port or USB cable from the Saturn to the PC, and turn on
      the Saturn.</li>
    <li>Under Windows, start the EPICS IOC and medm by running the batch file iocBoot/iocSaturn/START_IOC.bat.
      This can be done by double clicking on the icon for this file. You should see the
      EPICS IOC commands in a Windows command shell, and you should hear clicking sounds
      from the Saturn. If everything works correctly, you can then begin to collect and
      display spectra.</li>
    <li>Under Linux start the EPICS IOC and medm by running the script iocBoot/iocSaturn/START_IOC.
      This can be done by typing:
      <pre>      > cd iocBoot/iocSaturn
      > ./START_IOC
      </pre>
      You may need to edit the START_IOC script depending on how you chose to solve the
      root priviledge problem, and whether startWithIopl3 is in your path. You should
      see the EPICS IOC commands, and you should hear clicking sounds from the Saturn.
      If everything works correctly, you can then begin to collect and display spectra.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="Running_xMAP">
    Running the xMAP</h3>
  <p>
    There are several things that should be done to run xMAP system under the EPICS
    software.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>There are startup scripts and template files for systems with 4 or 16 channels
      (1 or 4 xMAP modules). If you have a different number of channels you will need
      to create new files.</li>
    <li>You can manually start the software by doing the following in the Cygwin bash
      shell:
      <pre>        cd iocBoot/iocXMAP  # Or the new directory you created
        ../../bin/cygin-x86/dxpApp.exe 16element.cmd  # Or 4element.cmd, etc.
     </pre>
    </li>
    <li>You can also start the EPICS IOC and medm by running the batch file iocBoot/iocXMAP/START_IOC_Cygwin.bat
      or START_IOC_WIN32.bat. This can be done by double clicking on the icon for this
      file. You should see the EPICS IOC commands in a Windows command shell, and you
      should hear clicking sounds from the xMAPS. If everything works correctly, you can
      then begin to collect and display spectra. You may need to edit these batch files
      to set the prefix for your IOC, the location of your medm adl files, etc.</li>
    <li>You can do scans and save complete spectra with the EPICS sscan and saveData facilities.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="Running_Mercury">
    Running the Mercury</h3>
  <p>
    The Mercury can be run under Linux (linux-x86 or linux-x86_64) or Windows (cygwin-x86
    or win32). As with the Saturn and xMAP described above there is an example mercury4.ini,
    and there are example startup scripts (START_IOC for Linux, and START_IOC_Cygwin
    and START_IOC_WIN32 for Windows).</p>
  <h3 id="Running_DXP2X">
    Running the DXP2X</h3>
  <p>
    The DXP2X is run under vxWorks. There is an example IOC for the DXP2X with startup
    ini files and scripts for 4 and 16 element systems. The ini file will need to be
    edited for the CAMAC address of the modules in your system.</p>
  <h2 id="Performance">
    Performance</h2>
  <h3>
    Normal MCA Spectra Mapping Mode</h3>
  <p>
    The following measurements were done in normal MCA Spectra mode with R3-0 of the
    dxp module to determine the performance of the DXP software in rapidly collecting
    complete spectra in a scan. The tests were done with the following conditions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Both cygwin-x86 and win32-x86 architectures on Windows. However, spectra were
      only saved to disk when testing with the cygwin-x86 architecture, because win32-x86
      does not currently support the saveData software.</li>
    <li>2048 channel spectra</li>
    <li>0.01 second acquisition time, in order to attain real data but with minimal overhead.</li>
    <li>EPICS scan records.
      <ul>
        <li>The inner scan was the scanH record, which had its detector trigger configured
          to the EraseStart record. Its detectors were configured to collect spectra from
          the MCA records. The Saturn collected 1 MCA spectrum at each scan point, the xMAP,
          Mercury, and DXP2X collected 4 or 16 spectra at each scan point.</li>
        <li>The outer scan was the scan1 record. It had no positioner drive PV to minimize
          overhead. The detector trigger was scanH.EXSC. Its positioner readback was "time",
          which is how the time to execute the scan was measured.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The scan fields of the MCA status, MCA read, and DXP read records were Passive
      to minimize overhead. The poller thread time was .01 seconds on the Saturn and DXP2X,
      .005 seconds on the Mercury, and .001 seconds on the xMAP. Callbacks caused the
      MCA records to be processed when acquisition was complete.</li>
    <li>saveData was used to save the scan data to a local hard disk, not across the network.</li>
    <li>1000 scan points were collected. There were no positioner or detector delays in
      the scan records.</li>
    <li>The scan records were running on the same IOC as the DXP software.</li>
    <li>The system configuration for the xMAP is shown in this screen shot.</li>

  <h3>
    Mapping Mode</h3>
  <p>
    The following measurements were done in using the MCA Mapping and MCA Mapping modes
    with R3-0 of the dxp module to determine the performance of the DXP software in
    rapidly collecting data in a scan. The tests were done with the following conditions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Both cygwin-x86 and win32-x86 architectures on Windows.</li>
    <li>2048 channel spectra in MCA Mapping mode</li>
    <li>32 SCAs (ROIs) in SCA Mapping mode</li>
    <li>External Sync pixel advance mode</li>
    <li>The external sync signal was generated with an SIS3801 multichannel scaler. The
      SIS3801 was operated in internal channel advance mode. The dwell time was set to
      be the fastest that would work before errors began, with 100 microsecond resolution,
      e.g. 3.6 ms per pixel worked and 3.5 ms per point failed.</li>
    <li>netCDF file saving plugin used to stream the data to a local disk.</li>
    <li>2000 points were collected.</li>
    <li>The system configuration for the Mercury test is shown in this screen shot.</li>
  </ul>
